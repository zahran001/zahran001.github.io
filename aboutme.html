					<h1>EXPERIENCE</h1>

					<h2>
						<strong>Software Engineer Intern</strong> | Rocket Mortgage |
						Detroit, MI | May '25 - August '25
					</h2>
					<p>
						&bull; Migrated a .NET microservice from AWS ECS to AWS EKS (Kubernetes with the Istio service mesh) using Helm, Terraform (IRSA/IAM), and GitHub Actions; executed a blue/green cutover via Amazon Route 53 weighted routing, enforced Istio mTLS and a default-deny ingress policy to implement a zero-trust model (encrypt east-west traffic and limit lateral movement), standardized cluster logging with Splunk OpenTelemetry Collector as a DaemonSet, added Dynatrace release correlation to tie releases to telemetry, and retired legacy ECS services and pruned related IaC—eliminating API Gateway/Lambda proxy overhead and improving deployment time by ~50% and API latency by ~33%, while strengthening security posture and reducing run-rate costs.
						<br />&bull; Built a distributed multi-agent mortgage processing system using Google A2A (JSON-RPC) and Anthropic MCP; designed an orchestrator agent (Gemini LLM + Google ADK) with auto-discovery of all agents and MCP tools, routing ~95% of queries to specialized agents handling loan lookups, historical case resolution, compliance validation, and pricing guidance, with a Flask UI, async task/state management, and circuit-breaker resilience — cutting query latency by ~40% and sustaining 100+ concurrent sessions in k6 load tests. Extended the system by integrating a .NET ServiceNow backend via MCP, leveraging Titan embeddings for semantic incident search, knowledge base retrieval, and ticket updates, enabling RAG workflows that reduced query latency by ~35% while ensuring legal compliance through a PII/PIFI redaction API and LLM-enforced guardrails.
						<br />&bull; Developed post–loan registration and non-agency product features in .NET 8 microservices and Angular by implementing mutator logic, feature flags, DI refactors, and Angular components with dynamic validators built on the Rocket Design System, validated through xUnit/Jest unit tests and a Playwright e2e suite integrated into CI/CD — reducing frontline support requests by ~80% and unlocking ~$246M in loan volume opportunity.

					<h2>
						<strong>Software Engineer Intern</strong> | Rocket Mortgage |
						Detroit, MI | May '24 - August '24
					</h2>
					<p>
						&bull; Designed and implemented new data fields across the
						<strong>Angular UI</strong> and <strong>.NET backend</strong> to
						optimize the VA IRRRL and FHA Streamline loan application process,
						ensuring accurate data transmission to downstream services, Rocket
						Logic and AMP, enabling brokers to lock rates without triggering any
						Qualification Failure Reasons. <br />&bull; Implemented
						<strong>automated</strong> API testing by migrating collections from
						Postman to Bruno, utilizing <strong>request chaining</strong> via
						Bruno CLI for integrating the tests into a
						<strong>CircleCI</strong> pipeline with <strong>Docker</strong> to
						ensure a consistent and isolated <strong>.NET</strong> application
						environment, enabling early issue detection and
						<strong>stable deployments</strong> with real-time monitoring via
						<strong>Dynatrace</strong>.
						<br />&bull; Led a local development environment optimization
						project, reducing development cycle times by utilizing
						<strong>Rancher</strong> networking configurations to orchestrate
						Docker containers for Angular UI, <strong>BFF</strong>, and .NET
						backend. Overcame cross-container communication challenges and
						streamlined workflows by integrating <strong>AWS SSM</strong> for
						secure parameter storage and leveraging <strong>AWS IIC</strong> for
						role-based access management, eliminating the reliance on external
						preview environments.

					<h2>
						<strong>Database Developer Intern</strong> | VS One Bangladesh
						Ltd. | Dhaka, Bangladesh | May '23 - July '23
					</h2>
					<p>
						&bull; Designed and implemented database structures using
						<strong>MSSQL</strong> and enhanced database performance by
						optimizing <strong>T-SQL</strong> queries. <br />&bull; Integrated
						<strong>Crystal Reports</strong> with MSSQL databases and
						implemented parameterized reports by addressing
						<strong>8</strong> user-specific report customization requests.
						<br />&bull; Documented and maintained
						<strong>3</strong> comprehensive entity-relationship diagrams,
						providing clear visual representations for future reference and team
						collaboration.

						semester, effectively serving over <strong>15,000</strong> guests,
						showcasing USF's facilities and academic programs to prospective
						students and their families. <br />&bull; Collaborated with the
						admissions team in coordinating large-scale events and group visits,
						effectively managing and engaging over <strong>1,200</strong> daily
						attendees, bolstering freshman experience and involvement.
						<br />&bull; Enhanced office management by streamlining schedule
						organization, appointment coordination, and supporting team members,
						ensuring seamless operational efficiency.
